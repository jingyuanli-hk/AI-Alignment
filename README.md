## Overview

This repository contains formal specifications and proofs related to AI alignment using the Lean 4 theorem prover. The goal is to provide mathematically rigorous formulations of key AI alignment concepts and properties, helping to build more secure and reliable AI systems.

## Motivation

AI alignment is the challenge of ensuring that artificial intelligence systems act in accordance with human values and intentions. Formal verification offers a promising approach to provide strong guarantees about AI behavior. This project uses Lean 4's powerful theorem proving capabilities to:

- Formalize alignment properties and safety guarantees
- Prove theorems about alignment mechanisms
- Create verifiable specifications for AI systems
- Explore the theoretical foundations of alignment
